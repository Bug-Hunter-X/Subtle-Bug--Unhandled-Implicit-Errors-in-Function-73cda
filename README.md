# Subtle Bug: Unhandled Implicit Errors

This repository demonstrates a Python function with a subtle bug. The function doesn't explicitly raise exceptions for all error conditions, leading to unexpected behavior or implicit errors that are not immediately obvious from the code. 

## The Problem
The `function_with_uncommon_error` function has a conditional logic flaw.  While it handles division by zero, it doesn't address the potential for unintended behavior or implicit errors that arise from the rest of the logic which are not explicitly exceptions. This can make the code harder to debug and maintain. 

## The Solution
The solution provided adds explicit error handling and input validation to address these scenarios.
